Small and simple implementations for various algorithms and data structures.
============================================================================

Function and macro documentation is in the headers.

Tests can be found in the <b>test\_*.c</b> files. The <b>test_tree.c</b> tests use some variadic macro magic to do "visual" testing on trees. Various other tricks can be found scattered throughout.

Running:
    $ make
    $ ./test

The entry point is in <b>test.c</b>.
